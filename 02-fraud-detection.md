# Capstone Project: Real-Time Fraud Detection System Using AWS Serverless

## Objective  
Your mission: Build a fully serverless fraud detection system for an e-commerce platform that processes transactions in real-time and detects fraudulent activities using TypeScript, AWS Lambda, API Gateway, Kinesis, DynamoDB, SQS, and SNS.

## Tech Stack  
- **TypeScript** - Strong typing, well-defined interfaces for transaction data modeling.  
- **AWS Lambda** â€“ Process transaction events in real-time, detecting potential fraud.  
- **API Gateway** - Create RESTful endpoints for transaction submission.
- **Amazon Kinesis** â€“ Capture and process streaming transaction data.
- **DynamoDB** â€“ Store transaction records and fraud detection results.
- **SQS** - Queue suspicious transactions for further review.
- **SNS** - Send notifications about fraudulent activities.

---

## Requirements  
This project focuses on building a serverless fraud detection system that analyzes e-commerce transactions in real-time. Here's what you'll build:  

- **Transaction Ingestion:** Accept transactions via API Gateway, where customers submit purchases through a REST API.
  - Create endpoints for transaction submission.
  - Validate incoming transaction data.
  - Forward valid transactions for processing.

- **Real-Time Processing:** Stream transactions using Kinesis for immediate fraud analysis.
  - Set up Kinesis data streams for transaction events.
  - Configure Lambda triggers for stream processing.
  - Handle high-volume transaction flow.

- **Fraud Analysis:** Evaluate transactions in AWS Lambda against predefined fraud detection rules.
  - Apply at least two fraud detection rules (detailed below).
  - Calculate risk scores for transactions.
  - Determine appropriate actions based on analysis.

- **Flagging Mechanism:** Send suspected fraudulent transactions to an SQS queue for further review.
  - Create queues for different risk levels.
  - Implement message handling for flagged transactions.
  - Ensure proper error handling and retries.

- **Data Storage:** Store all transactions (normal and flagged) in DynamoDB for record-keeping.
  - Design efficient data models for transaction storage.
  - Implement queries for transaction history retrieval.
  - Track historical patterns for future reference.

- **Alert System:** Send SNS notifications to the fraud investigation team when a transaction is flagged as fraudulent.
  - Configure SNS topics and subscriptions.
  - Format detailed alert messages with relevant transaction data.
  - Include risk assessment information in alerts.

## Fraud Detection Rules  
Implement at least two of these rules to flag potentially fraudulent transactions:

1. **Unusual Amount** â€“ Transaction amount significantly higher than user's average.
2. **Location Mismatch** â€“ Billing and shipping postal codes don't match.
3. **Rapid Transactions** â€“ Multiple purchases from the same user within minutes.
4. **Payment Method Change** â€“ User suddenly using a different payment method or card.
