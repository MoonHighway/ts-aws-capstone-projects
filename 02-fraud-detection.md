# Capstone Project: Real-time Fraud Detection System

## Objective  
Your mission: Build a serverless real-time fraud detection system for e-commerce transactions using TypeScript, AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, and Kinesis.

## Tech Stack  
- **TypeScript** - Strong typing, well-defined interfaces for transaction data modeling.  
- **AWS Lambda** â€“ Process transaction events in real-time, detecting potential fraud.  
- **Amazon Kinesis** â€“ Capture and process streaming transaction data.
- **DynamoDB** â€“ Store transaction records and fraud detection results.

---

## Requirements  
This project focuses on building a serverless fraud detection system that analyzes e-commerce transactions in real-time. Here's what you'll build:  

- **Transaction Processor** â€“ Create a Lambda function that:  
  - Consumes transaction events from Kinesis stream.
  - Applies basic fraud detection rules to each transaction.
  - Flags suspicious transactions based on predefined criteria.

- **Transaction Storage** â€“ Use DynamoDB to:
  - Store transaction records with fraud detection results.
  - Track historical transaction patterns for each user.

- **Basic Logging** â€“ Include simple console logging for important events.

## Sample Transaction Data  
To test your fraud detection system, use the following sample dataset.

## Fraud Detection Rules  
Implement at least two of these rules to flag potentially fraudulent transactions:

1. **Unusual Amount** â€“ Transaction amount significantly higher than user's average.
2. **Location Mismatch** â€“ Billing and shipping postal codes don't match.
3. **Rapid Transactions** â€“ Multiple purchases from the same user within minutes.
4. **Payment Method Change** â€“ User suddenly using a different payment method or card.

---

## Extra Credit!   
Want to enhance your fraud detection system? Try adding:  

- **Machine Learning Integration** â€“ Use AWS SageMaker to build a simple ML model for fraud prediction.
- **Real-time Alerts** â€“ Send notifications (via SNS) when suspicious transactions are detected.
- **Fraud Score API** â€“ Create an API endpoint to check a transaction's fraud probability.
---

## Submission Requirements  
- **GitHub Repo** â€“ Include your TypeScript code and a basic `README.md`.
- **Simple Diagram** â€“ Sketch how your components connect.
- **Short Demo** â€“ Be ready to show your system working live during presentation.
