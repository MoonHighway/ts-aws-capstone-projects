# Capstone Project: Serverless Product Search API with Event-Driven Processing

## Objective  
Your mission: Develop a serverless product search API using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, Kinesis, SQS, and SNS. The system should allow users to search for products efficiently and process product additions asynchronously.

## Tech Stack  
- **TypeScript** - Strong typing, structured API responses, and well-defined interfaces.  
- **AWS Lambda** â€“ Process search queries on-demand, without managing servers.  
- **API Gateway** - Create RESTful endpoints for your product search service.
- **DynamoDB** - Store and retrieve product data using Global Secondary Indexes.
- **Kinesis** - Stream product addition events for real-time processing.
- **SQS** - Queue product processing tasks for asynchronous handling.
- **SNS** - Send notifications to admin team for product additions.

## Requirements  
This project is all about creating a simple yet powerful product search service using **AWS Lambda and TypeScript**. Here's what you'll build:  

- **Product Search:** Enable users to search for products stored in DynamoDB using Global Secondary Indexes (GSI) for optimized queries.
  - Accept a search query (`GET /search?query=shoes`).
  - Fetch and return matching products from DynamoDB.
  - Implement efficient query filtering.

- **Asynchronous Processing:** Handle product additions through Kinesis and SQS, ensuring real-time analytics or logging.
  - Create endpoints for adding new products.
  - Stream new product data through Kinesis.
  - Process product additions using SQS for reliable handling.

- **Admin Notifications:** Notify the admin team via SNS whenever a new product is added.
  - Configure SNS topics and subscriptions.
  - Send detailed product information in notifications.
  - Include timestamps and relevant metadata.

- **TypeScript Best Practices** â€“ Use interfaces to keep your API responses and query parameters well-structured and predictable.

## Extra Credit!   
Feeling ambitious? Try adding one (or all) of these enhancements:  

- **Search Autocomplete** â€“ Make your search smarter by implementing basic prefix-matching for suggestions.  
- **Deploy to AWS** â€“ Get your API up and running with a complete cloud architecture.  
- **Basic Sorting** â€“ Let users sort results by price, rating, or other criteria.  
- **Analytics Pipeline** â€“ Track product search patterns and popular items.
- **Admin Dashboard** â€“ Create a simple interface for viewing notifications and product data.

---

## Submission Requirements  
- **GitHub Repo** â€“ Include `index.ts` (your Lambda function) and `README.md` with instructions.  
- **Architecture Diagram** â€“ Show how your AWS services connect together.
- **Short Demo** â€“ Be ready to show your system working live during presentation.
