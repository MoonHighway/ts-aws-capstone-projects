# Capstone Project: Product Search API 

## Objective  
Your mission: Build a **serverless product search API** that allows users to search for products using **TypeScript and AWS Lambda**, powered by **ElasticSearch** for fast and efficient results.  

## Tech Stack  
- **TypeScript** - Strong typing, structured API responses, and well-defined interfaces.  
- **AWS Lambda** â€“ Process search queries on-demand, without managing servers.  
- **ElasticSearch** â€“ Store and retrieve product data quickly and efficiently.  

---

## Requirements  
This project is all about creating a simple yet powerful product search service using **AWS Lambda and TypeScript**. Hereâ€™s what youâ€™ll build:  

- **Basic Product Search API** â€“ Create a Lambda function that:  
  - Accepts a search query (`GET /search?query=shoes`).  
  - Fetches and returns matching products from ElasticSearch.  

- **ElasticSearch Integration** â€“ Store a small sample of product data and retrieve relevant results.  

- **TypeScript Best Practices** â€“ Use interfaces to keep your API responses and query parameters well-structured and predictable.

## Sample Product Data  
To populate your **ElasticSearch index**, use the following sample dataset.

## Extra Credit!   
Feeling ambitious? Try adding one (or all) of these enhancements:  

- **Search Autocomplete** â€“ Make your search smarter by implementing basic prefix-matching for suggestions.  
- **Deploy to AWS** â€“ Get your API up and running with AWS API Gateway.  
- **Basic Sorting** â€“ Let users sort results by price, rating, or other criteria.  

---

## Submission Requirements  
- **GitHub Repo** â€“ Include `index.ts` (your Lambda function) and `README.md` with instructions.  
- **Deployed API Link (optional)** â€“ Share your API Gateway URL so others can test it.  
- **Short Demo** â€“ Be ready to show your system working live during presentation.
