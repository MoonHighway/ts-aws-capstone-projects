# Capstone Project: Serverless Subscription Management System

## Objective  
Your mission: Design a fully serverless subscription management system using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, Kinesis, SQS, and SNS to handle recurring payments, subscriber tracking, and lifecycle events.

## Tech Stack  
- **TypeScript** - Strong typing for defining subscription models and payment interfaces.  
- **AWS Lambda** â€“ Process subscription events, payments, and notifications.  
- **API Gateway** - Create endpoints for subscription management.
- **DynamoDB** â€“ Store subscriber data, payment history, and subscription status.  
- **AWS Step Functions** â€“ Orchestrate subscription workflows.
- **Kinesis** - Stream subscription events for real-time processing.
- **SQS** - Queue subscription tasks for reliable processing.
- **SNS** - Send notifications about subscription events.

## Requirements  
This project focuses on creating a robust subscription management system for a SaaS product. Here's what you'll build:  

- **Subscription Management:** Allow users to subscribe, upgrade, or cancel their plans.
  - Create endpoints for subscription operations.
  - Handle plan changes and subscription updates.
  - Process subscription cancellations and refunds.

- **Recurring Payments:** Automate subscription renewals and manage failed payments.
  - Schedule recurring payment processing.
  - Handle payment success and failure scenarios.
  - Implement retry logic for failed payments.

- **Lifecycle Tracking:** Monitor activation, renewal, expiration, and cancellation events.
  - Track subscription status changes.
  - Record important lifecycle milestones.
  - Manage free trial conversions.

- **Event-Driven Processing:** Use AWS services to handle asynchronous workflows efficiently.
  - Stream subscription events through Kinesis.
  - Process events using Lambda functions.
  - Queue tasks using SQS for reliable handling.

- **Notification System:** Notify users via SNS about payment failures, renewals, and cancellations.
  - Configure SNS topics and subscriptions.
  - Create templates for different notification types.
  - Trigger notifications based on subscription events.
