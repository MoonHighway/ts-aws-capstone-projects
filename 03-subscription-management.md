# Capstone Project: Subscription Management System

## Objective  
Your mission: Build a **serverless subscription management system** that handles recurring payments, subscriber tracking, and lifecycle events using **TypeScript, AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, and Step Functions**, with **Datadog** for monitoring.

## Tech Stack  
- **TypeScript** - Strong typing for defining subscription models and payment interfaces.  
- **AWS Lambda** â€“ Process subscription events, payments, and notifications.  
- **DynamoDB** â€“ Store subscriber data, payment history, and subscription status.  
- **AWS Step Functions** â€“ Orchestrate simple subscription workflows.

---

## Requirements  
This project focuses on creating a robust subscription management system for a SaaS product. Here's what you'll build:  

- **Subscription API** â€“ Create Lambda functions that:  
  - Handle subscription creation, updates, and cancellations.
  - Process recurring payments (simulated).
  - Track subscription status changes.

- **Subscriber Management** â€“ Use DynamoDB to:  
  - Store subscriber information and their active subscriptions.
  - Maintain payment history and subscription tier details.

- **Simple Workflow** â€“ Implement a basic Step Function to:
  - Manage subscription status changes (active â†’ canceled or past_due).
  - Handle basic subscription events.

- **Console Logging** â€“ Add simple logging for subscription operations.
